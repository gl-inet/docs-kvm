## FAQ

**Q1. What protocol does the USB receiver of the GL-Fingerbot use?**

A1. It uses Bluetooth protocol.

---

**Q2. Is the Fingerbot body paired with the USB Bluetooth receiver? If my USB Bluetooth receiver gets lost, can I use another one?**

A2. The Fingerbot and its USB Bluetooth receiver are uniquely paired. Other receivers cannot be used with the Fingerbot due to binding.

---

**Q3. Is GL-Fingerbot compatible with non-GL.iNet KVM devices?**

A3. No. GL-Fingerbot is an optional accessory for GL.iNet KVM devices. It should be used in conjunction with GL.iNet KVM.

---

**Q4. Can I use a single GL.iNet KVM to control multiple Fingerbots?**

A4. No. Currently a single GL.iNet KVM can only control a single Fingerbot.

---

**Q5. What does the Add-on for? How to use it?**

A5. The Add-on is designed to control regular power switch, such as a light switch. The Fingerbot's finger points to one side of the switch, while the Add-on attaches to the other side. When the Fingerbot presses down, it turns the switch on; when it pulls back, it turns the switch off.

However, Fingerbot can currently only be used with a GL.iNet KVM device. Find the USB Bluetooth receiver inside Fingerbot, insert it into the USB port of the GL.iNet KVM, and youâ€™ll be able to control Fingerbot through a GL.iNet KVM remotely.
