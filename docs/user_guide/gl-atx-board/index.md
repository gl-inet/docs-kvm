# ATX Board (GL-ATXPC) User Guide

The ATX board is an optional accessory for GL.iNet KVM device. As a smart power management module, it enables remote control of the controlled device's power supply by simulating physical power button operations (power on/off/reboot). 

The ATX board will be installed in the controlled device's chassis, providing more concealed and stable power management.

Explanation of Interfaces:

1. Type-C Interface: Connect to the KVM device.
2. Firmware Upgrade button: for the single-chip microcomputer on the ATX main board.
3. Reset button.
4. Connect to the control line of the computer panel.
5. Connect to the F_PANEL interface of the computer.

!!! note

    Interfaces 4 and 5 can be connected interchangeably. That is, interface 5 can be connected to the control line of the computer panel, and interface 4 can be connected to the F_PANEL. The LED status on the board is consistent with the Power LED status on the computer panel.

### 2. Install ATX Board into PC Case

Connect interfaces 4 and 5 respectively to the controlled PC's control line and F_PANEL interface. 

![interface connect](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/user_guide/gl-rm1/axt_package/interface_connect.jpg){class="glboxshadow gl-90-desktop"}

The 9-PIN Wire Set provided in the ATX Package allows you to connect one of the ATX board interface 4/5 to the controlled computer's control line or F_PANEL interface. 
    
You need to use the wire set included in your computer case to connect another ATX board interface 4/5 to the controlled computer's control line or F_PANEL interface.

**Note**: The interface polarity may vary depending on different PC case. Please double check it before installation.

Below are some examples of connecting interface 4/5 to the F_PANEL interface of the controlled computer for your reference.

??? "For 10-1 pin PANEL"

    If the row of pins on your controlled computer's motherboard used to connect to the control panel is a 10-1 pin PANEL, as shown below.

    ![10-1pin panel 1](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/user_guide/gl-rm1/axt_package/10-1pin_panel_1.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    Please refer to the diagram below for connection, make sure that the silkscreen printing (i.e., the words HDDLED±, RESET SW, POWER SW, POWERLED+, etc.) is visible facing outward and not obscured facing inward.

## FAQ

**Q1. Can I use the GL-ATXPC board with non-GL.iNet KVM devices?**

A1. No. GL-ATXPC board is an accessory for GL.iNet KVM devices. It should be used in conjunction with GL.iNet KVM.

---

**Q2. After installing the ATX board, what should I do if I cannot control the remote device's power (on/off) via the KVM?**

A2. Please try the following methods.

- Ensure the controlled device can be powered on/off normally when the physical power button on the PC case front panel is pressed.

- Check the wiring polarity. Try flipping the connector polarity on the controlled device's motherboard to avoid incorrect wiring.

    ![connector polarity](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/user_guide/gl-rm1/axt_package/flip_connector.png){class="glboxshadow gl-90-desktop"}

- When connecting to the F_PANEL interface on the controlled device's motherboard, ensure the silkscreen printing (e.g., HDDLED±, RESET SW, POWER SW, POWERLED+, etc.) is visible facing outward, not obscured facing inward.

- Upgrade the KVM's firmware.
