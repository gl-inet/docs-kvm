# Comet (GL-RM1) Quick Setup Guide

## Connect the Devices

For clarity, the controlling device is referred to as Device A, and the controlled device as Device B.

![connect devices](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/user_guide/gl-rm1/01_controlling-device-and-device-being-controlled.jpg){class="glboxshadow"}

1. Connect the Comet to the power source.

    ![power on](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/user_guide/gl-rm1/02_power-on.jpg){class="glboxshadow"}

2. Use an HD cable to connect the Comet's HD IN port to the HD OUT port of the Device B.

5. Device connection is complete. 

    You can now access the Comet's control panel locally via a browser on the controlling device, or download the GLKVM app on the controlling device to remotely access it.

## Local Access to Comet

There are two methods to access Comet via LAN.

**Method 1**. via Domain

First, ensure your controlling device is on the same LAN as your Comet.

Launch a browser on the controlling device. Chrome or Edge is recommended for better compatibility.

Enter `glkvm.local` in the address bar. You will be directed to the GLKVM login page. Enter the admin password.

![local access via domain](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/local_access_controlled_device_via_browser/local_access_domain_1.png){class="glboxshadow gl-90-desktop"}

You will be able to access the Comet's control panel locally, thus access the controlled device connected to it.

**Method 2**. via IP address

Find the IP address of Comet in the upper router, enter this IP address in the browser, and you will be able to access the Comet locally, thus access the controlled device.

Take GL-AXT1800 as an example: Comet is connected to the LAN port of GL-AXT1800 router via an Ethernet cable, and the controlled device is connected to Comet correctly via HD cable and USB cable.

Log in to the web admin panel of GL-AXT1800, find the IP address of Comet in the Client list, as shown below.

![local access via ip](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/user_guide/gl-rm1/local_access_via_ip.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Open a new tab in the browser, enter Comet's IP in the address bar. You will be directed to the GLKVM login page. Enter the admin password.

## Remote Access to Comet

**Method 1**. via Cloud service

This feature is available in firmware v1.5.0 and above.

1. Bind your device to KVM Cloud.

    This needs to be done within the local network.

    First, locally access your Comet, and go to the Cloud Service in the upper right corner. Click **Access Cloud**.

    ![access cloud](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/remote_access_controlled_device_via_cloud/access_cloud.jpg){class="glboxshadow"}

    You will be re-directed to a login page. Input your glinet account and click **Log In**.

    ![bind device login](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/remote_access_controlled_device_via_cloud/bind_device_1.png){class="glboxshadow gl-90-desktop"}

    Confirm your device info, and click **Bind**.

    ![bind device confirm](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/remote_access_controlled_device_via_cloud/bind_device_2.png){class="glboxshadow gl-90-desktop"}

    Wait a second and your device will be bound to your account successfully. Click **Done**.

    ![bind device success](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/remote_access_controlled_device_via_cloud/bind_device_3.png){class="glboxshadow gl-90-desktop"}

2. Remote access via Cloud service.

    Open a browser (take Google Chrome as an example), and enter `glkvm.com` in the address bar. You will see a login page. Use your glinet account to log in.

    ![remote access login](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/remote_access_controlled_device_via_cloud/remote_access_1.png){class="glboxshadow gl-90-desktop"}

    After login, you will see the devices bound to your account. Click on the device you want to remotely access.

    ![remote access select device](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/remote_access_controlled_device_via_cloud/remote_access_2.jpg){class="glboxshadow gl-90-desktop"}

    It will open a new tab asking for device admin password. Enter the admin password and log in.

    ![remote access admin](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/remote_access_controlled_device_via_cloud/remote_access_3.png){class="glboxshadow gl-90-desktop"}

    Then you will be able to access the KVM and the controlled device remotely via Cloud, without installing the app.

**Method 2**. via GLKVM App

1. Install the [GLKVM App](https://www.gl-inet.com/app-rm/){target="_blank"} on your controlling device.

2. Sign up and log in.
    
    Sign up for a GL.iNet account. If you already have one, skip this step.

    ![sign up](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/remote_access_controlled_device_via_glkvm_app/sign_up_account.png){class="glboxshadow"}
    
    Enter the username and password to log in.
    
    ![log in](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/remote_access_controlled_device_via_glkvm_app/log_in_account.png){class="glboxshadow"}

4. Bind your device.

    If your Comet and the controlling device are in the same local area network, click **Add Device**. It will start searching automatically.

    ![add device](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/remote_access_controlled_device_via_glkvm_app/add_device.png){class="glboxshadow gl-90-desktop"}

    If your Comet has not been detected or it is not in the same local network, click the **+** button in the upper right corner to add it manually.

    ![add manually](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/remote_access_controlled_device_via_glkvm_app/add_manually_1.png){class="glboxshadow gl-90-desktop"}

    Customize the device name and input the S/N, which can be found on the bottom label.

    ![add manually](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/remote_access_controlled_device_via_glkvm_app/add_manually_2.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    Binding device. Please ensure a stable network connection.

    ![binding](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/remote_access_controlled_device_via_glkvm_app/binding.png){class="glboxshadow gl-90-desktop"}
    
    Binding successful. Your Comet has been bound to your account. Click **Done**.

    ![binding successful](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/remote_access_controlled_device_via_glkvm_app/binding_successful.png){class="glboxshadow gl-90-desktop"}

    You will be directed to the homepage, where your Comet will be displayed Online.

    ![device online](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/remote_access_controlled_device_via_glkvm_app/device_online.png){class="glboxshadow gl-90-desktop"}

    Click on it, input the admin password (created during the first access), and you can remotely access the Comet's control panel, thus access the controlled device connected to it.

    ![remote access via app](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/remote_access_controlled_device_via_glkvm_app/remote_access_via_app.jpg){class="glboxshadow gl-90-desktop"}

**Method 3**. via Tailscale

Comet integrates with Tailscale, allowing you to remotely access it via Tailscale virtual network.

In Comet's control panel, navigate to Apps Center -> Tailscale, bind Comet to your Tailscale account. 

Next, bind your controlling device to the same account. Then you will be able to remotely access your Comet by typing its Tailscale virtual IP into a web browser on the controlling device, without installing GLKVM app.
