## Highlights

- **5G RedCap**

    Comet 5G integrates cutting-edge 5G RedCap technology to provide flexible internet access, freeing your deployments from the constraints of fixed on-site networks.

- **Network Failover**

    Coupled with integrated cellular connectivity, Wi-Fi 6, and Ethernet failover support, Comet 5G ensures continuous uptime; should one connection fail, it seamlessly and automatically switches to the next available network, allowing uninterrupted remote KVM operation even in challenging conditions.

- **Dual-Band Wi-Fi 6**

    Comet 5G supports dual-band Wi-Fi 6 (2.4GHz and 5GHz), providing high-speed, low-latency, and stable wireless connectivity for remote operation and data access.

- **Near-Field Access via AP Mode**

    Comet 5G features Wi-Fi Near-field Control, enabling quick local configuration and management without wired connections. Simply switch the Wi-Fi network mode to AP mode, and it will generate a unique Wi-Fi SSID. Users can connect to this SSID to securely access the management interface for device setup or maintenance.

    **Note**: Activating the AP disconnects the device from its upstream Wi-Fi and provides local access only (with no internet connectivity).

- **Browser-Based Remote Access**

    Comet 5G allows users to access the KVM interface directly through a web browser, eliminating the need for client installation. This browser-based access uses secure HTTPS encryption and avoids self-signed certificate warnings, ensuring safe and effortless connectivity without additional software.

- **Sleek Design & Touchscreen**

    Comet 5G features a dark gray body with smooth contours, rounded corners, and a textured matte finish that offers both durability and a premium feel. The 3.69-inch TFT touchscreen provides an intuitive interface for quick access to device functions, ensuring a seamless user experience.

- **4K Display & Two-Way Audio**

    Comet 5G supports video output up to 4K@30FPS with HDMI out passthrough, allowing simultaneous local display and remote access without an external splitter. It also features two-way audio, enabling clear communication for video conferencing or remote technical instruction.

- **Self-Hosted Deployment**

    Comet 5G enables flexible self-hosted deployment on mainstream operating systems, including Linux and Ubuntu, giving users full control over remote access and data privacy. The self-hosted system requires a cloud server with at least a dual-core CPU and 2GB of memory, ensuring both privacy and reliable operation.

- **Remote Power Control**

    Comet 5G features a USB interface for connecting external devices such as an ATX board and a Fingerbot, enabling remote power control of the connected equipment.

    **Note**: Optional accessories sold separately.
