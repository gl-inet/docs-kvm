# Accessory Guide

GL.iNet offers optional accessories for KVM devices to provide additional convenience for remote management.

## Fingerbot

The Fingerbot, acting as a physical button emulator, is designed to enable remote control of physical power button on the controlled device. 

Please refer to [GL-Fingerbot (FGB-01) User Guide](../gl-fgb-01/index.md){target="_blank"} for details.

## ATX Board

The ATX Board, acting as a smart power management module, enables remote control of the controlled device's power supply by simulating physical power button operations (power on/off/reboot). 

Unlike the Fingerbot, which controls device through physical button presses, the ATX main board will be directly installed in the controlled device's host box, providing more concealed and stable power management.

Please refer to [GL-ATX Board User Guide](../gl-atx-board/index.md){target="_blank"} for details.
