# Why is the device not powered on though the power cable is connected?

If your KVM device fails to start up with the power cable connected, use the following methods to troubleshoot.

1. Ensure the power cable is plugged in to the proper USB Type-C port.

    Take Comet (GL-RM1) as an example. It has two USB Type-C ports: One for power input (connected to a power adapter), the other for signal transmission (connected to the controlled device via USB cable).  

    If the two ports are reversed, the KVM will not be powered on, and the mouse & keyboard will not respond to input.  

    Please plug the power cable into the the USB Type-C port next to the Ethernet port.

2. Use common 5V 2A power adapters to test and check if the LED lights up.

    Avoid using PD protocol power adapters.

    A solid blue LED indicates the device starting up.

3. Press and hold the Reset button for more than 8 seconds to restore factory settings.
