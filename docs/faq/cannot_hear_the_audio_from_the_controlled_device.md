# Why can't I hear the audio from the controlled device?

After connecting the KVM and the controlled device, if you fail to hear the audio from the controlled device, for example, cannot hear the audio while playing video on the controlled device, here are some troubleshooting tips:

1. Check the wiring. Make sure that all cables are firmly connected between the KVM and the controlled device. Loose wiring may affect the audio output.

2. Check whether an HDMI converter is connected. Some converters do not support audio.

3. Check whether the controlling device and the controlled device are set to mute.

4. Check the graphics card driver of the controlled device. If the controlled computer does not have a graphics card driver, it will not be able to output audio, thus the sound cannot be heard at the controlling end.
