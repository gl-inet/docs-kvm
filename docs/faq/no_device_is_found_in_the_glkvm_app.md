# What should I do if no device is found in the GLKVM app?

When adding a KVM device for the first time, if you select **Auto Discover**, it may display **No device found** in the GLKVM app.

Here are some troubleshooting tips:

1. Make sure all cables, including Type-C cable for power input, HDMI cable, Ethernet cable (if required), USB-A cable, are properly connected to your KVM device.

2. Make sure your KVM is connected to the Internet. A solid-white LED indicates normal network connectivity.

3. Make sure your KVM and the controlling device are connected to the same network.
