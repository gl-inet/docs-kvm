Here are some troubleshooting tips:

1. Make sure all cables, including Type-C cable for power input, HDMI cable, Ethernet cable, USB-A cable, are properly connected to the interfaces of your KVM device.

2. Make sure the KVM is connected to the Internet. A solid-white LED indicates normal network connectivity.
