# Privacy error when accessing KVM locally via browser

When accessing the GL.iNet KVM locally via browser by entering the domain "glkvm.local" or the KVM's local IP assigned by the upper router, you may encounter a browser alert: **Your connection isn't private**.

![privacy error](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/privacy_error_from_your_browser/privacy_error_1.png){class="glboxshadow"}

This is a standard security warning that browsers issue when they detect a website lacking an SSL/TLS certificate, as HTTPS connections rely on certificates to verify server identity and encrypt data.

## Why do I get this warning?

In the example above, the IP "192.168.8.11" is the KVM's local IP address dynamically assigned by the upper router via DHCP. 

!!! Note

    If the gateway of your router which your GL.iNet KVM is connected to is "192.168.x.1" (where x is typically 0, 1, or 8 in private networks), the local IP of your KVM should be "192.168.x.y" (where y is a valid host address in the subnet).

This local IP is used to access the GL.iNet KVMâ€™s local management interface, not a public website.

However, browsers usually do not distinguish between local management IP addresses and normal websites; they treat all IP addresses as websites and expect HTTPS connections to be secured by SSL/TLS certificates.

A genuinely secure website uses an SSL/TLS certificate, so when browsers access a local management IP (which does not have a certificate), they trigger a security alert due to the missing certificate.

## What can I do with this alert?

Please click **Advanced** and **Continue to "192.168.8.11"**.

Then you will be re-directed to the GL.iNet web management page.

## Can I add a SSL certicate in the KVM?

Yes, you can add your SSL certicate in the GL.iNet KVM.

First, please apply for an SSL cert or use a self-signed SSL cert. 

Then, SSH into your GL-iNet KVM or use WinSCP to upload the updated certificate and key to the KVM. The path is `/etc/kvmd/nginx/ssl`.
