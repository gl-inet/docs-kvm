# How to unbind my KVM device from the Cloud?

There are three ways to unbind KVM devices from the Cloud.

**Method 1**. Unbind in local access

1. Ensure your computer is on the same local area network as your KVM device.

2. Launch a web browser on your computer (Chrome or Edge is recommended for better compatibility). Enter `glkvm.local` or the KVM's IP address in the address bar to access the GLKVM local login page. Enter the admin password to log in.

3. After login, navigate to the **Cloud Service** in the upper-right corner, click the gear icon and select **Unbind**.
