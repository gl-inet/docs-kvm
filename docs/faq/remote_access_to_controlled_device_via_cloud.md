# How to remotely access the controlled device via Cloud service?

Before you begin, please ensure the following:

- The controlled device is connected to the KVM correctly.
    
- The KVM is connected to a stable network.

- You can access the KVM locally, as binding device to the Cloud needs to be done within the local network.

Follow the steps below to remotely access your KVM and the controlled device via Cloud service.

## 1. Bind your device to KVM Cloud

Locally access your KVM, and go to the Cloud Service in the upper right corner. Click **Bind To Cloud**.

You will be re-directed to a login page. Input your glinet account and click **Log In**.

It will open a new tab asking for device admin password. Enter the admin password and log in.
