# How to remotely access the controlled device via Cloud service?

**Note**: This feature is available in firmware v1.5.0 and above.

Before you begin, please ensure the following:

- The controlled device is connected to the KVM correctly.
    
- The KVM is connected to a stable network.

- You can access the KVM locally, as binding device to the Cloud needs to be done within the local network.

Follow the steps below to remotely access your KVM and the controlled device via Cloud service.

## 1. Bind your device to KVM Cloud

Locally access your KVM, and go to the Cloud Service in the upper right corner. Click **Access Cloud**.

You will be re-directed to a login page. Input your glinet account and click **Log In**.

Confirm your device info, and click **Bind**.

## 2. Remote access via Cloud service

Open a browser (take Google Chrome as an example), and enter `glkvm.com` in the address bar. You will see a login page. Use your glinet account to log in.

After login, you will see the devices bound to your account. Click on the device you want to remotely access.

It will open a new tab asking for device admin password. Enter the admin password and log in.

Then you will be able to access the KVM and the controlled device remotely via Cloud, without installing the app.
