# How to remotely access the controlled device via GLKVM app?

Before you begin, please ensure the controlled device has been connected to the GL.iNet KVM correctly, and the KVM is connected to Internet stably.

Follow the steps below to remotely access the controlled device via GLKVM app.

## 1. Install GLKVM app

Install the [GLKVM App](https://www.gl-inet.com/app-rm/){target="_blank"} on your controlling device. It supports Windows and macOS.

## 2. Sign up and log in

Sign up for a GL.iNet account. If you already have one, skip this step.
