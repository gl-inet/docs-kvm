# Why can't my speaker/microphone settings be retained?

You may notice that if you enable Speaker or Microphone on the KVM's control panel (Settings -> Remote Device Settings), these settings won't be kept when you restart, re-login to KVM or refresh the webpage (in local access). 

Instead, the Speaker will be automatically disabled, and the Microphone, though it still shows as enabled after you restart the device or refresh the webpage, will be muted.

This is because, due to browser security policies, the Speaker and Microphone are disabled/muted by default every time you restart, re-login to KVM or refresh the webpage (in local access). You can enable them manually if needed. 

Authorization is required when enabling the Microphone for the first time, as shown below.
