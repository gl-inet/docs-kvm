A3. Wake on LAN (WOL) is a technology that allows a computer or device to be remotely powered on or awakened from a low-power state over a network. It works by sending a "magic packet" containing the target device's MAC address, which triggers the device to start up. Common uses include remote administration, energy-saving standby configurations, and centralized system management.
