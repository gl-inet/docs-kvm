**Q3. What is Wake-on-Lan?**

A3. Wake-on-LAN (WOL) is a technology that allows a computer or device to be remotely powered on or awakened from a low-power state over a network. It works by sending a "magic packet" containing the target device's MAC address, which triggers the device to start up. Common uses include remote administration, energy-saving standby configurations, and centralized system management.

**Q4. Does Comet support Mouse Jitter?**

A4. Yes. Comet supports mouse jitter function from firmware v1.3.

The mouse jitter function is applied to prevent the computer from entering sleep due to prolonged inactivity (e.g., remote meetings, server management), assist in game idle status (when users leave the keyboard temporarily) to avoid being detected as offline by the system, and simulate user operations in software automated testing to ensure stable program operation.
