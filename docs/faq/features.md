**Q1. Do I have to use KVM cloud service?**

**Q2. Can I use Comet to control multiple devices?**

A2. No. Comet and Comet PoE can only control one device. 

To control multiple devices, you can either purchase multiple Comets and bind them to the same GL.iNet account, or purchase a third-party KVM switch with Hotkey Switching and use it in conjunction with Comet/Comet PoE. Note: Compatibility issues may arise.

**Q3. What is Wake-on-Lan?**

A3. Wake-on-LAN (WOL) is a technology that allows a computer or device to be remotely powered on or awakened from a low-power state over a network. It works by sending a "magic packet" containing the target device's MAC address, which triggers the device to start up. Common uses include remote administration, energy-saving standby configurations, and centralized system management.

**Q4. Does Comet support Mouse Jitter?**

A4. Yes. Comet supports mouse jitter function from firmware v1.3.

The mouse jitter function is applied to prevent the computer from entering sleep due to prolonged inactivity (e.g., remote meetings, server management), assist in game idle status (when users leave the keyboard temporarily) to avoid being detected as offline by the system, and simulate user operations in software automated testing to ensure stable program operation.

**Q5. Does Comet support remote microphone (i.e., transmitting audio from the controlling device to the controlled device)?**

A5. This feature will be available from firmware v1.4.0.
