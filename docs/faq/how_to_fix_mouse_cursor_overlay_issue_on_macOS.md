When using GL-RM1, you may get the issue that the mouse cursor of the controlling device can't be superimposed on the controlled macOS device.

It's related to the display resolution. The macOS resolution is different from that of GLKVM.

Please go to the Settings -> Displays -> Optimize for.

Change it to **GLKVM**.

![select glkvm](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/mouse_cursor_overlay_issue/select_glkvm.png){class="glboxshadow gl-60-desktop"}

Choose the Resolution you prefer, and youâ€™ll find the mouse cursor is superimposed. Then you can enjoy using it.
