It's related with the display resolution. The resolution is different from GLKVM.

Please go to the Settings -> Displays -> Optimize for.

Change it to **GLKVM**.

![select glkvm](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/kvm/faq/mouse_cursor_overlay_issue/select_glkvm.png){class="glboxshadow gl-60-desktop"}

Choose the Resolution you prefer, and youâ€™ll find the mouse cursor is superimposed. Then you can enjoy using it.
