# Can Comet (GL-RM1) connect to wireless network?

Comet (GL-RM1) does not support connecting to wireless network. 

It needs to be connected to a network device (e.g., a router) via an Ethernet cable for Internet access, as shown below.

If you prefer to purchase a KVM that supports Wi-Fi, you may consider Comet Pro (GL-RM10), a remote KVM over Wi-Fi solution.
