# How to delete my Cloud account?

For security reasons, you may delete your cloud account if it is no longer in use. 

**WARNING**:

1. GL.iNet routers and KVM devices share a unified cloud service. If you delete your cloud account, the change will take effect for both routers and KVM devices.
2. Deletion will permanently erase all associated services, data, and personal information, with no option for recovery.
3. Please leave all organizations before proceeding with deletion.
