# How to set a static IP for KVM?

This tutorial introduces the steps to set a static IP for your GL.iNet KVM directly on the console when its upstream router can't allocate one.

The following steps take Comet (GL-RM1) as an example.

1. Log in to your Comet's console, and navigate to **Settings** -> **Network** -> **Modify**.

2. Switch to the **Static** tab. Specify an IP address, Netmask, Gateway and DNS server for your Comet, and click **Confirm**.
