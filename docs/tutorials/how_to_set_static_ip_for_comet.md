# How to set a static IP for KVM?

If you need to set a static IP for Comet but its upstream router can't allocate one, you can customize network parameters on Comet to configure it.

1. Log in to your Comet's control panel, and navigate to **Settings** -> **Network** -> **Modify**.

2. Switch to **Static** tab. Specify the IP address, Netmask, Gateway and DNS for your Comet, and click **Confirm**.
